# Welcome to Python Bookstore

We are pleased to have you here :joy:!

This is a simple Python project, meant to help me develop my programming skills. This is a simple online bookstore, where the user/client buys books. It has an inventory, prices, discount prices, and prints a receipt.

## Basic Features

Basic features include:

- Add books to inventory
- Remove book from inventory when purchased
- Calculate the bookstore’s total profit
- Calculate total + shipping
- Offer free shipping when it reaches a certain value
- Add book to inventory when returned
- Subtract from the bookstore’s profits when a book is returned
- Print receipt
